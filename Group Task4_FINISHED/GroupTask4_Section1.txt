i. 
There is evidence of imbalance. According to logit results, kwh_2009_09, kwh_2009_12, D_4701.2_1 are significantly different in the treatment and control group. In addition, D_420.3.0 also is at the threshold for significantly different in the treatment and control group. 

According to t-test results, 12 variables have t-statistics greater than 2, indicating significant difference in the mean of the variable between treatment and control group. 

**DAN: no need to put output. I can generate it myself!**

ii. 
Significant variables in the logit model and the t-test are different. Out of the 12 significant variables identified in the t-test, only two variables (kwh_2009_09 and kwh_2009_12) are also identified in the logit model. 
In the logit model, all the coefficients on the variables are generated after controlling all the other variables. However, the t-test only considers difference in means and does not control for other factors.


iii.
Logit Pros: 
1. control for other factors in the regression, which generates accurate estimation of significance level. **Not true.**
2. The results are more robust. The independent variables don’t have to be normally distributed. **Not true**
3. Logit model does not assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable. 


Logit Cons: 
1. Over-fitting: since the logit model predicts results based on independent variables, it might not have as much predictive power as it appears due to sampling bias. 
2. It might have omitted variable bias if not enough significant predictor of treatment assignment is included in the model. Therefore, logit model requires more data to achieve unbiased estimates.


T-test Pros: 
1. T-test is easy to calculate. It requires less data than the logit model. **Not sure what you mean by "less data".** With data on variable of interests, results can be calculated by hand.
2. T-test is easy to interpret. The t-test result itself can indicate whether the treatment and control group are balanced or not.


T-test Cons: 
1. T-test doesn’t control for specific variables influencing treatment assignment. 
2. T-test assumes normal distribution of the variables. **It actually doesn't!**
3. Some t-test assumes equal variance. **But you can choose!**


iv. 
Question 405  is relatively irrelevant in the set of questions. The internet access cannot influence the household electricity use  in a clear way.


Question 410, 420, and 43111 all ask for people living in the household (e.g how many people under or over 15 years old live in the house). Question 470 and 4701 are also addressing the same issue: the heating source for the household. These questions are redundant, which might result in multicollinearity. 


Demographic and socioeconomic information on household age, gender, income as well as the basic characteristics of house such as square-footage and location should be included in the logit model.  

**Nice response!**
