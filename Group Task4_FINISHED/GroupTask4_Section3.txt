i. 
Both the magnitude and the significance of the coefficient for TP changed after applying weights. The coefficients became significant after applying weights. 

**DAN: By how much? In what direction? Use the numbers! -1 pt**


ii. 
The coefficient on treatment-trial interaction variable represents the program impact. According to the unweighted regression results, holding other variables constant, the consumption of electricity of  treatment C4 receivers decreases by 0.8% after program implementation. However, the p-value (0.537) is NOT small enough to say the coefficient is statistically significant. In other words, treatment C4 does NOT cause people to reduce energy use in a statistically significant way. 


iii. 
The coefficient on treatment-trial interaction variable represents the difference in difference estimate of program impact. According to the weighted regression results, holding other variables constant, the consumption of electricity of  treatment C4 receivers decreases by 2.53% after program implementation. In addition, the p-value (0.009) is small enough to say the coefficient is statistically significant. In other words, treatment C4 does cause people to reduce energy use in a statistically significant way. 


iv. 
There are two threshold questions to verify whether the propensity score can reduce bias on coefficients with weighting: “1) Were relevant variables omitted from the causal model? 2) Is there enough information to estimate the propensity scores with good accuracy?” (Freedman & Berk, 2008)


From section I, the sample is imbalanced and the propensity score is constructed based on survey questions that are irrelevant, redundant, and missing variables. Therefore, there is evidence that there is bias in propensity score and weights, which leads to biased coefficients. The coefficient estimate of the treatment effect is not believable.

**BOOM. Nicely done!**
